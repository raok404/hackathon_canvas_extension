## Why Early Bird
Research shows that many students struggle from procrastination.
In UFâ€™s National College Health Assessment (NCHA) survey (2020), about 43.6% of students reported that procrastination had negatively impacted their academic performance in the past year
64.4% of those who experienced procrastination said it negatively affected academics.

Early Bird aims to help students by gamifying studying: by awarding students points when they finish assignments. By automatically displaying all the tasks due in the coming week, it makes it easy for students to identify what they should work on so they can put their energy towards studying. There is a built-in focus timer and calendar as well, so students can access every study tool in one place.

## What's Next
We aim to incorporate a "smart" ranking feature for tasks, where AI will use information about the assignments to rank them on how urgently they should be finished. This tool could help students plan their study time more efficiently.
